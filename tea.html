                <p>The continent of Khorvaire is recovering from a long and destructive war, trying to redeem over a century of blood thristy hatred with the boom of magically enabled technology. The cities seem to grow around the former broken ghettos that the war left, bringing a the shabby and broken facades into the new vast sea of magic laden steal and prism glass.</p>
                <p>But the scars of war have to not yet healed. Though the steam from mechanical wonders fills every street and the masses enjoy the fruits of machinist and magicians cooperation, and thread of vile animosity threads it's way through daily life, giving a darkness to even the brightest lit places in Eberron.</p>

                            House Cannith is a human dragonmarked house whose members are well known for their innovation and advancements in technology. They are responsible for technological wonders such as the Warforged and the Lightning rail. House Cannith provide repair services and the house's gorgon mark is a known and trusted symbol that appears on magical and mundane items. Through past wars Cannith have become the most politically powerful Dragonmarked House.

                            House Deneith is a human dragonmarked house whose members are highly-acclaimed mercenaries and bodyguards known for their efficiency and martial skill. Deneith are the muscle of the dragonmarked houses, providing raw power to a nation's army. Taking sides is bad for business, so during the Last War, Deneith remained neutral and provided soldiers to all sides. Now that the war has ended Deneith members are hired for guarding monarchs and chasing down criminals.

                            House Ghallanda is a halfling dragonmarked house found throughout Khorvaire. Ghallanda is one of the few Dragonmarked Houses that are not involved with some form of arms dealing or soldiering, instead Ghallanda are Eberron's best hosts dealing in food and shelter.

                            The Mark of Healing first appeared among the halflings of the Talenta Plains about three thousand years ago, but the Jorasco family eventually moved its headquarters to Karrnath
to better serve greater Khorvaire. For this reason, most of the Jorasco halflings are cosmopolitan and cultured in the traditions of the Five Nations, with few ties to the ancient nomadic ways of the Plains.
Today, the Healers Guild of House Jorasco tends to the well-being of most of Khorvaire. Using both mundane and magical healing techniques, as well as alchemy and herbalism, the healers of House Jorasco deal in curing illnesses, tending wounds, and treating mental maladies in their hospitals and healing enclaves.

                            House Kundarak is a Dwarven house with services focused in security and banking. Their primary customers are those who have enough coin to buy something worth protecting including the wealthy, the powerful, other dragon marked houses and even state governments. They are the wealthiest Dragonmarked House by far and their banking establishments can be found all over Khorvaire.

                            House Lyrandar consists of half-elves with the Mark of
Storm. With outposts in Breland, Aundair, Zilargo, Thrane, Valenar, and Karrnath, House Lyrandarâ€™s shipping and transporation services rival those of House Orien, and the two often compete over contracts that could be fulfilled over either land or sea. The half-elves find few opportunities in the Lhazaar Principalities, however, and often come into conflict with ships of the Lhazaar princes in the open seas.

                            The half-elves of House Medani carry the Mark of Detection. House Medani originated in pre-Galifar Breland fifteen hundred years ago, using its abilities to detect threats to foresee dangers and establish a base of power related to knowledge in the wake of the War of the Mark.

                            The first dragonmarks appeared among the elves of Aerenal more than three
thousand years ago. The Mark of Shadow and the Mark of Death appeared at about the same time, and the elves quickly understood the significance of the event. House Phiarlan organized around the Mark of Shadow and began turning the abilities provided by the mark into an economic dynasty. However, with the slaughter of the House of Death twenty-six hundred years ago, House Phiarlan left Aerenal and relocated
to Khorvaire, where the elves intermingled with humans and helped lay the foundation for the Five Nations.

                            Once part of House Phiarlan, the elves of House Thuranni formed their own house during the Last War as the conflict began to turn various house factions against each other. Now Thuranni competes directly with Phiarlan in the areas of espionage, surveillance, and information brokering, as well as in entertainment and artisan endeavors. The two houses share the Mark of Shadow,
though the newer version of the house in many ways remains the weaker of the two.

The Mark of Finding first appeared in the Shadow Marches about one thousand years ago. After being visited by House Sivis representatives five hundred years ago, the holders of the mark decided to follow the example of the gnomes and form an economic force of their own.

                <p>The warring king's houses have become capitalistically competing guilds, using the marketplace as their battlefield. The main industry guilds have become swamped with other, more unusual guilds. For when the armies were disbanded, the need for quiet killers arose. So some negotiation for reasources go on in the day, in public meeting places, but the true power plays are those that come and go without being seen, and with as little blood splatter evidence as possible.</p>

                <p>So although it is not named the assassins guild, few question the purpose of Sharn's Guild of Contracts. Likewise the Guild of Special Transportation, is known to locals as the theives guild. The strangest guild of all, which even the street ruffs admit to not knowing it's true, certainly nefarious purpose, is the Guild of Normalacy.</p>
