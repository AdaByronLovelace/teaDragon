                    <p>The continent of Khorvaire is recovering from a long and destructive war, trying to redeem over a century of blood thristy hatred with the boom of magically enabled technology. The cities seem to grow around the former broken ghettos that the war left, bringing a the shabby and broken facades into the new vast sea of magic laden steal and prism glass.</p>
                    <p>But the scars of war have to not yet healed. Though the steam from mechanical wonders fills every street and the masses enjoy the fruits of machinist and magicians cooperation, and thread of vile animosity threads it's way through daily life, giving a darkness to even the brightest lit places in Eberron.</p>

                    <p>The warring king's houses have become capitalistically competing guilds, using the marketplace as their battlefield. The main industry guilds have become swamped with other, more unusual guilds. For when the armies were disbanded, the need for quiet killers arose. So some negotiation for reasources go on in the day, in public meeting places, but the true power plays are those that come and go without being seen, and with as little blood splatter evidence as possible.</p>
                    <h2>And no place are the guilds powers more evident than in towering and mountainous Sharn, the greatest city of the realm. Where in it's grimey alleys, trouble finds the adventurer, not the other way around.</h2>
                    <p>So although it is not named the assassins guild, few question the purpose of Sharn's Guild of Contracts. Likewise the Guild of Special Transportation, is known to locals as the theives guild. The strangest guild of all, which even the street ruffs admit to not knowing it's true, certainly nefarious purpose, is the Guild of Normalacy.</p>
