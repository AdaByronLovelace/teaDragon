Today, the Healers Guild of House Jorasco tends to the well-being of most of Khorvaire. Using both mundane and magical healing techniques, as well as alchemy and herbalism, the healers of House Jorasco deal in curing illnesses, tending wounds, and treating mental maladies in their hospitals and healing enclaves.</div>
